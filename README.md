# Algorithm Analysis

Active repository for testing design choices on various data structures and types of algorithms to solve problems. 
Applying principles of computing to identify solutions to given problems, then implementing and evaluating an appropriate computing-based solution to meet given set requirements.

All algorithms tested and developed in Java.
